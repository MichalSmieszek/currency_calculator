# currency_calculator

This project was written in java and spring boot. I count monthly net salary in PLN from daily gros salary in optional currencies.< br/>

In project I found two problems. At first I don't know, how i can test value of currency, unit test probably isn't a good option, because currencies changes. <br />

Secondary I have problem with Access-Control-Allow-Origin error( even simple fetch didn't work, in project I have simple js UI, because I don't know front-end frameworks). I didn't include that file, there were 3 buttons, 1 inputtext, 1 div and function, which didn't work. <br />
Due to evening extra classes from python (16.04 - 19.04), all day Scrum activities(20.04-22.04) and some projects and test at University,
I haven't enough time to solute that problem.<br />

I did unit test to count and round value of net value.<br />

I think, that code is clear, names of variables, methods and classes  decribe well problem.<br />

Some commits disappeared. The reason is the project suddenly started to have some errors. I pulled from github last version.
I don't know, why commits  were removed. <br />
Thank you in advance for your time, checking this solution.<br />
